      <h2>Gas booking portal</h2>
      <br/>
      <p>Certainly! A gas booking portal is an online platform that allows consumers to book LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)
      <br/>cylinders for their household or commercial use.<br/>
        These portals are typically provided by gas companies and offer a convenient way for customers to place orders, make payments,<br/>
         and schedule deliveries without the need to visit a physical location.
<br/>
Here are some key features of gas booking portals:
<br/>
- Online Booking: Customers can book refill cylinders online at any time.
<br/>
- Multiple Booking Modes: Apart from the web, bookings can be made via SMS, IVRS (Interactive Voice Response System), and mobile apps.
<br/>
- Payment Options: Users can make payments through various modes, including online payment methods.
<br/>
- New Connections: The portal may also facilitate the registration for new gas connections.
<br/>
- Customer Support: Users can give feedback, log complaints, and access safety-related information.
<br/>
These portals aim to enhance customer convenience and streamline the process of LPG distribution.
